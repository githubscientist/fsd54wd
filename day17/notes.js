    What is a promise?

    Promise is an object which holds the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
    It is a placeholder for the result of an asynchronous operation. It will become available at some point in future.

    Callback Functions: Give me a function, I will call it back later.

    Callback functions are the functions which are passed as arguments to other functions. The other functions will call the callback functions later.

    Promise States:
    1. Pending: Initial state of a promise. It is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    2. Fulfilled: The operation is completed successfully.
    3. Rejected: The operation is failed.
